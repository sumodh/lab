# 🧪 lab_python

Welcome to my Python lab! This is where I save my code in the following topics for quick reference:

- 🐍 Core Python programming
- 🧠 Machine Learning and AI
- 📊 Data Science and analysis
- 📚 Algorithms and data structures

## 📁 Structure
[matplotlib](./matplotlib/) – Data visualization using Matplotlib


## 🧠 Goals

- Master Python programming
- Apply AI and ML techniques to real-world problems
- Build a portfolio of projects across Python subfields
- Document learning in a clean, shareable way
