# Understanding core Libraries
# foundational tools for working with data

# NumPy

# provides a powerful array object much more efficeint for storing and
# manipulating large datasets than standard Python lists
# Provides high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays


# Pandas

# builds on NumPy and introduces the DataFrame, which is like a spreadsheet
# or a SQL table
# makes it incredibly easy to handle tabular data, perform operations like 
# filtering, grouping, and merging, and deal with missing values

# Matplotlib

# foundational toolkit for creating plots. 
# gives control over every single element of visualization,
# from lines and points to axes and labels

# Seaborn

# is built on top of Matplotlib
# provides a higher-level interface for drawing attractive and
