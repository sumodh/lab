# Scatter plots are useful for showing the relationship between two variables. 
# They can help identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between the variables.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Dummy data
x = [5, 7, 8, 7, 2, 17, 2, 9, 4, 11]
y = [99, 86, 87, 88, 100, 86, 103, 87, 94, 78]

# Creating the scatter plot
plt.scatter(x, y, color='g')

# Adding title and labels
plt.title('Scatter Plot of X vs Y')
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')

# Show plot
plt.show()
