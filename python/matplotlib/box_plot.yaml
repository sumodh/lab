# Box plots are useful for visualizing the distribution of a dataset through its quartiles.
# They provide a clear summary of the data's central tendency, variability, and potential outliers.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Dummy data
data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

# Creating the box plot
plt.boxplot(data)

# Adding title and labels
plt.title('Box Plot of Data')
plt.xlabel('Data')
plt.ylabel('Value')

# Show plot
plt.show()
